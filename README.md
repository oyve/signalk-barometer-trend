# signalk-barometer-trend
Analyzes and calculates the tendency and trend of barometer readings over a one or three hour period including barometric weather predictions. Is foul weather on the horizon?

Barometric forecasts:
- 0–6 hours: Most accurate (e.g. rising pressure = clearing weather).
- 6–12 hours: Still reliable, especially when combined with other data.
- 12–24 hours: Starts to lose precision.
- Beyond 24 hours: Not dependable alone — needs satellite, radar, and models.

## Prerequisites
- A barometer, i.e. the [bme280](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=bme280), outputting `'environment.outside.pressure'` to SignalK
- Optional: GPS-coordinates to determinate if located in northern | southern hemisphere (default: northern)
- Optional: Temperature sensor and GPS-altitude for increased precision

## Install & setup
Install the plugin through the SignalK plugin interface. 'Enable' it through the Plugin Config interface.

- Sample Rate: More | fewer readings. This may result in a more | less "jumpy" barometer-trend. (Default = 60).
- Altitude Offset: Ajust for any differences between your sensor altitude to GPS-altitude. (Default = 0).

## Use
It might take a couple of minutes before the plugin show any data, as it need to collect pressure readings to calculate a trend. The plugin will not change the pressure readings you observe in SignalK - only internally for calculations.

The plugin outputs several new SignalK-values, such as:

```
'environment.outside.pressure.trend.tendency'
'environment.outside.pressure.trend.severity'
'environment.outside.pressure.prediction.pressureOnly'
...
```

The plugin saves all barometer readings every 3 minutes and when the plugin is disabled. Within a timeframe of 3 hours it should be able to read meaningful data when the plugin is started again.

## Alarms
Based on the severity value it's possible to set an alarm, using the [Simple Notification](https://github.com/sbender9/signalk-simple-notifications)-plugin (see severity table below).

`'environment.outside.pressure.trend.severity'`

FALLING: | RISING:
------------ | -------------
(0) FALLING.STEADY | (0) RISING.STEADY
(-1) FALLING.SLOW | (1) RISING.SLOW
(-2) FALLING.CHANGING | (2) RISING.CHANGING
(-3) FALLING.QUICKLY | (3) RISING.QUICKLY
(-4) FALLING.RAPIDLY | (4) RISING.RAPIDLY

## Real world example
This is actual data while developing the plugin. A tropical wave, OT-48, was moving through the Caribbean creating local heavy rainfall and stormy winds in Guadeloupe.
